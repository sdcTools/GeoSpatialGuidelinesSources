These guidelines were written in the framework of the project on Statistical
Methods and Tools for Time Series, Seasonal Adjustment and Statistical Disclo-
sure Control (in short: STACE), co-financed by the European Union by means
of grant agreement 899218 â€“ 219-BG-Methodology. Work package 2 of this
project concerned a Center of Excellence on Statistical Disclosure Control (CoE
on SDC) which was formed by the national statistical institutes (NISs) of The
Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Iceland, Slovenia, Poland and Bulgaria.
One of the goals of this CoE was to provide three guidelines for applying SDC.
The CoE, together with Eurostat and the European Expert Group on Statistical
Disclosure Control, decided on three topics for these guidelines: (1) Guidelines
for SDC methods for Census and Demographics Data, (2) Guidelines for SDC
Methods Applied on Geo-Referenced Data and (3) Update of the General SDC
Handbook.
A subgroup of the CoE on SDC was formed by the NSIs of Germany, Austria,
France, The Netherlands and Poland. This subgroup worked on the Guidelines
for SDC Methods Applied on Geo-Referenced Data. The current document is
the result of this work.
